# Page Repair (prototype)

A user-invoked browser extension that repairs broken web pages for screen
reader users — fixing unlabeled controls, broken heading structure, and
missing landmarks with targeted ARIA patches that keep the page fully alive.

**Not an overlay.** Overlays are site-installed, run automatically, claim
compliance, and are widely hated by the people they claim to serve. This is
the inversion: user-installed, user-invoked, fixes only what it can verify,
and says so honestly.

## Research grounding

Built from a deep-research pass (WebAIM Screen Reader Surveys #7/#10, the
Overlay Fact Sheet, NFB position statements, ASSETS 2024/2025 papers) and a
close read of "From Cluttered to Clear" (ASSETS 2025, arXiv:2502.18701) —
the closest prior art. Key evidence:

- 85.9% of screen reader users say better *websites* would help more than
  better assistive tech (WebAIM #10). The top problems are content-authoring
  failures: unlabeled buttons, bad headings, chaotic dynamic content.
- The ASSETS 2025 study proved LLM page restructuring significantly improves
  task times and experience (n=15) — but did it by regenerating the entire
  page as text-only HTML: scripts stripped, visuals destroyed, 220K tokens,
  $0.50–$2.20 and 1–5 minutes per page, applied automatically with no user
  control and no provenance.
- Their own formative participants asked for the opposite: "I prefer browsing
  myself because I can control what I do with my screen reader."

## Design rules (each traceable to user evidence)

1. **User-invoked only** (toolbar / Alt+Shift+R). Never runs on page load.
   Uses `activeTab`, so the extension can't even see a page until asked.
2. **ARIA patches, never rewrites.** Site JavaScript, visuals, and
   interactivity keep working — including for low-vision users who pair
   magnification with a screen reader.
3. **Deterministic first, LLM second.** Heading-level repair and landmark
   fixes are computed locally and applied in milliseconds. Only genuinely
   ambiguous unlabeled controls go to the model — just their local HTML
   context, never the full page.
4. **Confidence-gated labels with provenance.** High-confidence labels apply
   as-is; medium-confidence labels carry an "auto-labeled, unverified" note
   in `aria-description` — after the name, so braille displays and
   voice-control name matching stay clean; low-confidence guesses are
   discarded. A wrong label is worse than none.
5. **Never speak uninvited, never move focus.** One polite live region
   announces what was *actually applied* — never a fix that silently failed
   — only right after the user invoked the repair.
6. **Reversible.** Every patch records the attribute values it replaced;
   Alt+Shift+U restores the original page. If an SPA re-render wipes a
   patch, re-invoking repair is the recovery path — the extension never
   fights the page for its own attributes.
7. **Report, never contact.** A command copies a plain-language audit report
   (WCAG references, heuristic disclaimer) to the clipboard for the *user*
   to send. Automated complaints would poison the reporting channel and
   disclose the user's disability status without their say — so that
   feature is deliberately absent.

## Measured (see `test/latency.mjs`)

| Page | Audit | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| Hacker News (34 KB) | 3.9 ms | 31 unlabeled controls (vote arrows) |
| Craigslist (59 KB) | 5.8 ms | 3 heading repairs, missing main landmark |
| Wikipedia (119 KB) | 2.0 ms | nearly clean (negative control) |

Deterministic fixes land in single-digit milliseconds. LLM labeling is one
structured API call over a pruned context (~2 orders of magnitude fewer
tokens than full-page regeneration).

## Try it

1. `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → this folder.
2. Options page → configure labeling (only needed for unnamed controls;
   heading/landmark repair works with no configuration at all):
   - **Prepaid credits.** A credit token routes labeling through the metered
     proxy in [`proxy/`](proxy/README.md); no Anthropic account needed.
   - **Your own API key.** Calls go straight from the browser to Anthropic;
     auditable, nothing passes through our servers. Wins if both are set.
3. On any page: press Alt+Shift+R or click the toolbar button. Alt+Shift+U
   undoes all repairs; a third command (unbound by default — see the options
   page) copies an accessibility report to the clipboard.

Tests: `npm install`, then `npm test` (unit: selector round-trip invariant,
heading repair, accessible names, apply/undo) and `node test/latency.mjs`
(audit timings; `--llm` adds one live labeling call with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
Fixture regeneration: [`test/README.md`](test/README.md).

## Next

- **Participatory design** — recruit blind co-designers (NVDA/JAWS users
  first: ~78% of primary desktop use) before building further. Nothing about
  us without us. Everything else waits on what testers say.
